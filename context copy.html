        <p>The Reading Viaduct, built in the late 19th century, helped support manufacturing and trade.</p>
        <p>Industrial decline began after World War II, leading to vacant buildings and economic downturn.</p>

        <p> Philadelphia’s Chinatown was established in the mid-19th century by Chinese immigrants fleeing discrimination on the West Coast.

        <p> Today, however, rising rent prices are putting pressure on long-time residents and small businesses, threatening the neighborhood’s cultural identity.</p>

        <h3>Problem 1: Gentrification</h3>
        <p>Construction of large-scale development projects has led to displacement of business and residents as the area became more “desirable” with higher sales price and cost of living.

        <p>Therefore, in order to solve some of the negative effects mentioned above, and to unite the neighborhood once again, the Chinatown Stitch Project was put in place. </p>
        <p>The Chinatown Stitch Project is a recreational project that seeks to reconnect the neighborhoods North and South of the highway by capping sections of the Vine Street Expressway between 10th and 13th streets. </p>
        <p>Phase One of this project, shown in the illustration, cost about 160 million dollars and is funded mostly by the US Department of Transportation as well as the city and its local partners. Currently in the design and engineering stage, Chinatown Stitch is expected to start construction in 2027 and is expected to be completed in early 2030.</p>
